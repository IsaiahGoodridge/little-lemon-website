Follow this URL to view the deployed website: https://651ec837be42df0008db3a6e--prismatic-khapse-160e3d.netlify.app/

## Technology Used
React.js | HTML | CSS

## Motivation
The Little Lemon Restaurant was the capstone project for the Meta Front-end Developer Professional Certificate. It involved taking a provided design and implementing it from scratch.

After designing the website, the final goal was to create a booking form that connects to an API, fetching available times based on the date chosen. 

## Functionality
Initially, the website will only have booking form functionality by clicking on the "Reserve Table" link. I will update the website with more functionality as my learning continues.
