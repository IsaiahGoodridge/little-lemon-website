The Little Lemon Restaurant was the capstone project for the Meta Front-end Developer Professional Certificate. It involved taking a provided design and implementing it from scratch.

After designing the website, the final goal was to create a booking form that connects to an API, fetching available times based on the date chosen. 

Initially, the website will only have booking form functionality. I will update the website with more functionality as my learning continues.
