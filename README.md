The Little Lemon Restaurant was the capstone project for the Meta meta front end developer professional certificate. It required to take a provided design and implement it from scratch.

After designing the website, the final goal was to create a booking form that connects to an API, fetching available times based on the date chosen. 

Please note that initially the website will only have booking form functionailty. I will update the website with more functionality as my learning continues.
